<h5>Explainer</h5>
<h6>Changes from the Pokemon to the Tamigucho universes:</h6>

<p><small>Probably the Tamigucho universe was discovered by a villain from the fourth region in the Pokemon universe, who brought with him Lillie and N when the former two convinced three legendary mons through a battle also using three legendary mons to make this universe (using space, time and power; and also light, darkness and cosmos energy). Other universes with brand new undiscovered mons turned discoverable and communicable after this event.</small></p>

<p><small><b>"Up to 6 creatures to travel"</b>: Bill's granddaughter travelled back in time to visit him, and told she discovered the meta/multiverse; she also invented better mon transportation techniques in the Tamigucho universe that enabled to <b>carry up to 8 mons</b> before transferring the next to her PC system.</small></p>

<p><small><b>"Evolutions", "Mega-Evolutions" and "Gyms"</b>: just nomenclature changes.</small></p>

<p><small><b>"After captured, creatures "magically" obey the trainer"</b>: N and Bill's granddaughter united to change how pokeballs work and also how the psychology of Tamigucho's mons would be different</small></p>

<p><small><b>"Creatures have 1 egg at once", "Ovparous reproduction" and "Shiny"</b>: the new mons DNA had some characteristics of non-light-based/non-powerful animals from other universes; the Tamigucho universe contains different parts from different universes, and is thought to be related to Silvally.</small></p>
